In general, analyses of the impacts of weather-related road closures have focused on short-term, major events, such as hurricanes. There has been little focus on the ability for weather-related disruptions of varying size and severity (from localized tree fall to major hurricanes) to cause cumulative impacts to the population over longer time scales. This analysis considers daily impacts to free-flow travel time by employing an adjusted graph theory approach that also considers demand to more effectively analyze travel time impacts.
