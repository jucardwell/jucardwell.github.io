I am a Teaching Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography and Environment at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. I teach courses related to spatial data science and am passionate about improving spatial data science education through evidence-based pedagogy. 

I am deeply committed to Open Science and focus on training students to value and practice principles like reproducibility, transparency, ethical data use, and open data sharing. I emphasize the importance of clear documentation, robust data management practices, and the use of reproducible workflows to ensure their work can be understood, evaluated, and built upon by others. I am also invested in teaching spatial data science through open-source software like R and QGIS. 

My research examines the function of rural road networks under disruptive events (such as road closures due to extreme weather events). I have a particular interest in advancing computationally efficient method to more realistically represent travel behavior using a graph theory approach.
