This course is designed to assist students in developing skills for the utilization of Geographic Information Systems for spatial analysis. Combining the theoretical foundations of GIS with instruction on introductory to advanced geoprocessing and spatial analysis techniques (with a focus on combining these techniques for comprehensive analysis), this course prioritizes “doing GIS” with a focus on reproducibility and automation, data management principles, working with large or messy data, and visualizing results.
