This course introduces students to maps and geospatial technologies as both everyday technical tools and powerful ways of shaping knowledge. The course examines how geographic information has been collected, represented, and used throughout history to influence what people see, understand, and value about the world. Students will develop an understanding of fundamentals of spatial data, explore methods of data collection such as GPS and remote sensing, apply principles of cartographic design and map interpretation, and analyze how mapping has been used to produce, reinforce, and contest power throughout history.
