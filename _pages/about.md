I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Geography and Environment at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and a Graduate Research Associate at the [Southeast Regional Climate Center](https://sercc.com/). I expect to graduate in May 2025. 

My research interests have broadly focused on the social impacts of extreme weather events. Some of my previous work has focused on equity in FEMA aid spending after hurricanes, local news sentiment towards FEMA, access to healthcare facilities during flood scenarios, and community perceptions of floodplain buyout programs. My dissertation research examines the road network connectivity impacts of weather-related road closures in North Carolina. 

I am a broadly trained spatial data methodologist. My methods experience spans remote sensing (traditional and cloud-based), advanced spatial analysis in R, machine learning applications, high-performance computing, and spatial statistics. I have expertise in GIS software (ESRI products, QGIS), spatial databases, web mapping, and making public-facing data visualizations. 

I have experience as an Instructor, Teaching Assistant, and Graduate Research Consultant for a variety of undergraduate courses focused on GIS, spatial analysis in R, introductory physical geography, and environmental conservation. My teaching philosophy is driven by an investment in evidence-based teaching strategies, an adaptable and responsive teaching approach, a commitment to undergraduate research opportunities, a genuine interest in engaging with students, and a deep love of teaching and learning.
