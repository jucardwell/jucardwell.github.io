I am a Teaching Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography and Environment at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. I teach courses related to spatial data science- from introductory survey courses to advanced methods courses. 

I am deeply committed to Open Science and focus on training students to value and practice principles like reproducibility, transparency, ethical data use, and open data sharing. I emphasize the importance of clear documentation, robust data management practices, and the use of reproducible workflows to ensure their work can be understood, evaluated, and built upon by others. All my course materials are freely available for use, adaptation, and distribution for non-commercial purposes under the Creative Commons CC BY-NC license.

My research examines the function of rural road networks under disruptive events (such as road closures due to extreme weather events). I have a particular interest in advancing computationally efficient method to more realistically represent travel behavior using a graph theory approach.
