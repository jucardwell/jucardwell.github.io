I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Geography and Environment at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. I am a Graduate Research Associate at the [Southeast Regional Climate Center](https://sercc.com/) and a Data Verification Specialist at the [Odum Institute for Research in Social Science](https://odum.unc.edu/).

My research interests focus on the societal impacts of extreme weather events. My dissertation research examines the road network connectivity impacts of weather-related road closures in North Carolina. Some of my other research has focused on equity in FEMA aid spending after hurricanes, local news sentiment towards FEMA, access to healthcare facilities during flood scenarios, and community perceptions of floodplain buyout programs.
