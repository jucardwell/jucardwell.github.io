A survey of geographic data sources including maps, photos, digital images, Census information, and others. Emphasis is on appropriate uses, limitations, and skilled interpretation in physical and human geography applications. This is a concept- and data-driven course that introduces students to geographic data and core geographic concepts. Students will interpret and evaluate spatial datasets (including their acquisition, limitations, and ethical considerations), understand how geographic data is structured and represented, and apply foundational GIS methods and spatial reasoning to analyze real-world issues.
