Acquisition of flood risk properties is becoming an increasingly common practice for floodplain risk management. While these buyout programs are often seen as highly effective in achieving their primary goal—reducing flood risk—there are additional variables that should be considered when assessing overall effectiveness of these programs, including potential equity concerns, and community sentiment surrounding post-buyout land use. This study examines the floodplain buyout program in Charlotte, North Carolina, with special consideration for these additional variables. The floodplain buyout program in Charlotte is seen as effective in reducing flood risk, but specific community and neighborhood experience with the buyout program differs significantly. While some communities feel that the flood buyouts were equitable and just, and are able to ascribe land uses to the vacant land that add community value, some communities have differing experiences. The study indicates the continued importance of community-specific examination of the effectiveness of recovery programs, and the importance of continued consideration for community experience in the post-buyout period.
