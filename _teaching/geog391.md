Geographers use quantitative methods to describe, estimate, and predict spatial patterns. The class covers the fundamentals of quantitative reasoning in geography, including data visualization and mapping, data description and summary, statistical inference and significance tests, and spatial patterns in events, values, and across continuous surfaces. Adopting a “spatial-first” perspective, the class emphasizes the distinctive characteristics of spatial data that both challenge and extend conventional statistics.
