I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Geography and Environment at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and a Graduate Research Associate at the [Southeast Regional Climate Center](https://sercc.com/). I expect to graduate in May 2025. 

My research interests focus on the societal impacts of extreme weather events. My dissertation research examines the road network connectivity impacts of weather-related road closures in North Carolina. Some of my other research has focused on equity in FEMA aid spending after hurricanes, local news sentiment towards FEMA, access to healthcare facilities during flood scenarios, and community perceptions of floodplain buyout programs. 

I have experience as an Instructor, Teaching Assistant, and Graduate Research Consultant for a variety of undergraduate courses focused on GIS, spatial analysis in R, introductory physical geography, and environmental conservation.
